    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
        <p> This project is part of a big programming competition that is held by MIT. Our class did not participate due to time frames but we competed against the other group in our class. The main objective of this program is to take the interface and maps that were made by MIT and make the blank characters work and try to beat the other team.</p>
      <h3>What We Accomplished</h3>
        <p>We were first given a miner and soldier. With the basic code that was given, we made the movement and detection system for the miner. Then we worked on the soldier learning how to implement opponent and wall detection. The middle stages of this project were focused on the characters that were not given. This included the laboratory, watchtower, and sage. Of these three we started with the laboratory. This would turn the lead into gold.  This was beneficial because if you had more gold than the opponent you would win. We also worked on the sage which allowed us to attack with more power but it was much soldier so we stuck with the soldier. Our strat did not use the watchtower so we didn't attempt them.</p>
      <h3>What Was Learned</h3>
        <p>The main skill that I improved from this project was the ability to pick up a language and learn it quickly to implement it efficiently. his was also my first team coding project. There was a lot to learn about communication and implementation with a team-style of programming.</p>
