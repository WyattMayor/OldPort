    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
        <p> The main idea of this project was to explore the pandas library in python. There was multiple steps to this project. We first started with basic data wrangling. In this part of the project we learned how to read in a CSV and convert it to a dataframe that can be used to make graphs. The middle stage of this project included creating static graphs and learning how to specify values within the dataframe. In this stage of the project the main focus was learning how code and manipulate the graphs to make them visually pleasing. The last part of the project included using FIP codes to make a chloropleth map and add animation. The animation shows the change in new cases(hotspots) over a given period of time.</p>
        <h3>What Was Accomplished</h3>
      <p>We were able to get multiple visualizations for USA, Illinois, and Knox county. We completed Total cases, New cases, Cases per 100000, and two cholorpleth maps that were based on states and counties. Overall as group we learned the basics of plot.ly and how to wrangle dataframes to a usable form. </p>
      <h3>Teamwork Overview</h3>
      <p>Throughout this project we had three members in our group. Our approach to this project was one person coding as the others watched and gave ideas. Our meeting time was limited however we tried to meet outside of class as often as we could. Even though our time was limited we were able to accomplish a fair amount of graphs and write decent amount of code.</p>
