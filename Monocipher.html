    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
        <p> This project was for my Data structures and Algorithms class. In this project, we created a command-line program using python. This program can encrypt and decrypt text with a simple alphabet key. Key generation is also a feature that is offered. Key generation can be done with a regular alphabet and shifted/reversed or the user can insert a keyword before shifting and reversing. The final feature that I implemented in this program was the ability to do single and multi-letter frequency analyses. The English language uses certain three letter, two letter, and single-letter words more often than other words. Frequency analysis can help the user figure out where they might be placed.</p>

      <p>*****************MonoCipher*****************

<br>Decipher(-d):
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -d cipher.txt key.txt plain.txt
<br>-d will Decipher an encrypted text with a given key and then output a file with the decrypted text
<br>
<br>Encryption(-e):
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -e plain.txt key.txt cipher.txt
<br>-e will Encrypt text with a given key and output the excrypted text file.  
<br>
<br>Key Generation(-k):
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -r
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -s
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -s 4
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -r -s 4
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -r -s -4
<br>-k will generate a key for encryption. using -k then follow by a -r will create a reversed key. -k followed by -s will shift the key to the right by a specified number if there is not a specified number then it will shift 1 by default. If you want to shift left the input needs to be positive if you want to shift right the input after -s needs to be negative.
<br>
<br>Key Generation With Keyword(-k), (-kw):
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -kw "keyword" -r
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -kw "keyword" -s
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -kw "keyword" -s 4
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -kw "keyword" -r -s 4
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -k key.txt -kw "keyword" -r -s -4
<br>-k will generate a key for encryption. -kw will then insert a keyword at the beginning of the key. using -k then follow by a -r will create a reversed key. -k followed by -s will shift the key to the right by a specified number if there is not a specified number then it will shift 1 by default. If you want to shift left the input needs to be positive if you want to shift right the input after -s needs to be negative.
<br>
<br>Frequency Analysis(-a):
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -a cipher.txt Analysis.txt
<br>-a will do a single letter frequency analysis on the cipher text and write it to the second text file that was specified.
<br>
<br>Multiple Letter Frequency Analysis(-a):
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -a 2 cipher.txt Analysis.txt
<br>Command Line Usage: python3 monocipher.py -a 3 cipher.txt Analysis.txt
<br>-a followed by another number will do a multiple  letter frequency analysis on the cipher text and write it to the second text file that was specified.</p>
